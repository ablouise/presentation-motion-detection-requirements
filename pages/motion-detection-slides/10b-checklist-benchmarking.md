# Technical Deliverables Checklist: Benchmarking, Integration & Performance

## Benchmarking & Validation
- [ ] Benchmarking suite for recall, precision, AUC, false positive rate, CPU usage
- [ ] Import and catalog datasets (I-Lids, NGD, MP4, annotated ground truth)
- [ ] Event-based validation (true/false positives, automated comparison)
- [ ] Real-time progress tracking and drill-down visualization
- [ ] Export results (PDF, CSV, raw data)
- [ ] Robustness and scalability tests (lighting, weather, occlusion, density)

## Integration
- [ ] Arcules cloud analytics configuration (rule-based alarms, Smart Search, API integration)
- [ ] XProtect plugin architecture (C# and C++), device-activated integration
- [ ] Sequence Explorer support for event playback/search
- [ ] Event sync reliability between Arcules and XProtect

## Performance Optimization
- [ ] FFmpeg optimized for all supported video streams (H.264, H.265, AV1, with/without B-frames)
- [ ] CPU utilization profiling and tuning for entry-level and high-end hardware
- [ ] Throughput and latency benchmarks for 50â€“500 camera scenarios
