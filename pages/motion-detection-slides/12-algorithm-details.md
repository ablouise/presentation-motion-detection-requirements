# Algorithm Details (Reference Slide)

**Cascaded Approach:**
- Leverages compressed stream data for motion detection
- Segmentation & clustering of motion vectors
- Scene-adaptive logic and ignore zones
- Stationary filtering and depth normalization
- Self-supervised learning for adaptation
- All processing is CPU-only, multi-threaded, and scalable
